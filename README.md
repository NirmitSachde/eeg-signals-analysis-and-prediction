### BON EEG Database Analysis

**File Name:** `BON_EEG_Database.ipynb`

**Description:**
This project involves analyzing EEG data from the BON EEG Database to understand brain activity patterns, focusing on seizure detection and classification.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes handling missing values, feature scaling, and data normalization.
- **Feature Extraction:** Calculates various statistical features like mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, etc.
- **Visualization:** Utilizes Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting EEG signals and statistical distributions.
- **Model Training:** Implements machine learning models for seizure classification.

**Setup:**
1. **Environment:** Python 3.x with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.
2. **Data:** Access the BON EEG Database or similar EEG datasets.
3. **Execution:** Run the notebook to preprocess data, extract features, and train models.

**How to Use:**
- Load and preprocess EEG data as outlined in the notebook.
- Extract features and visualize them.
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for seizure detection.

**Contributing:**
- Contributions to improve model accuracy, add new datasets, or enhance visualization are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit pull requests.
